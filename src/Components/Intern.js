            Worked as Intern in Gemini Solutions Pvt Ltd for 13 months from 4th
            April 2022 to 19th April 2023.During my recent internship, I had the
            opportunity to learn HTML,CSS,Java, Javascript,Bootstrap, Node.js,
            React.js,NextJs and work with React.js and Next.js, a popular
            JavaScript library for building user interfaces. As a front-end
            intern, my main responsibility was to develop and maintain the
            front-end components of a web application using React.js. During the
            internship, I gained hands-on experience in building reusable and
            scalable React components, using React's component-based
            architecture to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. I
            also learned how to manage state and props in React components, as
            well as how to use React's built-in hooks, such as useState and
            useEffect, to manage component lifecycle and handle state changes. I
            worked closely with the development team and participated in code
            reviews, learning from experienced developers and gaining insights
            into best practices for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable
            React code. I also collaborated with the back-end team to integrate
            the front-end components with the RESTful APIs to fetch and display
            data from the server. Throughout the internship, I sharpened my
            problem-solving skills by identifying and fixing bugs, as well as
            optimizing performance and improving the user experience of the web
            application. I also had the opportunity to contribute to the
            planning and implementation of new features, brainstorming ideas,
            and providing input on UI/UX design decisions. Overall, my
            internship experience with React.js was highly valuable, allowing me
            to apply my theoretical knowledge of React.js to real-world projects
            and gain practical skills in building modern, interactive web
            applications. I am grateful for the opportunity and look forward to
            further enhancing my skills in React.js and front-end development in
            my future endeavors.
